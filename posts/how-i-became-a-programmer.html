                <h4>How It All Started</h4>
                <p>
                    Throughout my life, as far as I can remember, I've always
                    had a strong passion for technology. From building toy cars
                    with cardboard and small electric motors to fixing damaged
                    electrical appliances and debugging JavaScript codes, I've
                    always loved tech innovations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first heard the words <b>programming</b> and
                    <b>hacking</b> from my older brother when he was learning
                    about the internet. He didn't tell me much, but it sparked
                    my curiosity. Unfortunately, I couldn't do much at the time
                    because I didn't have access to the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    About a year later, during my second year in high school, a
                    teacher encouraged us to learn a digital skill.
                    Coincidentally, I had just created my first email account a
                    week prior. I told my teacher that I had just started
                    learning to code, and that statement turned out to be one of
                    the best decisions of the year. Days passed, and he invited
                    me to join a Python programming class he was teaching to two
                    other students. Before then, I had already begun learning
                    Basic programming language on my own.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>First Lessons</h4>
                <p>
                    At that time, I had access to the internet using my parents'
                    mobile phones, but I didn't have one of my own.
                    <br />
                    He taught us how computers work, the differences between
                    compilers and interpreters, the levels of programming
                    languages, and most importantly, the basics of Python.
                    <br />
                    One of the students learning with us dropped out,
                    complaining that programming was too complicated, reducing
                    our class size to two. (It was a free class, by the way.)
                    <br />
                    He taught us about <b>arrays</b>, <b>variables</b>,
                    <b>lists & tuples</b>, <b>input types</b>, and <b>loops</b>.
                    <br />
                    Just as everything seemed to be going well, life started to
                    take unexpected turns. Unfortunately, he left the school to
                    focus on his life and tech career.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>My Big Switch</h4>
                <p>
                    After he left, I struggled to finish learning Python and
                    wasn't sure what to do next.
                    <br />
                    The other person learning programming with me wasn't very
                    good and probably quit. (He was a senior in my school, and we
                    weren't friends.)
                    <br />
                    Without a mentor to guide me, I ended up learning Java,
                    Ruby, and a bit of Kotlin.
                    <br />
                    Programming became boring, and I quit for the first time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A year later, my sister's classmate mentioned that she was
                    learning web development and boasted about being able to
                    build Facebook.
                    <br />
                    That sparked something in my mind and motivated me to return
                    to programming. She advised me to start with <b>HTML</b>,
                    which I did, as I saw her as a professional developer
                    already.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I began learning HTML on
                    <a href="https://sololearn.com">Sololearn</a>, which she
                    recommended.
                    <br />
                    After a few days of learning HTML, I realized I didn't fully
                    understand what I was learning. I had previously learned a
                    few programming languages, all of which involved naming
                    variables and calling functions.
                    <br />
                    I later discovered through a Stack Overflow thread that HTML
                    was only a markup language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After completing my HTML and CSS courses, I moved on to
                    JavaScript and built several projects, including calculators
                    and my very first portfolio website.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Graduation and Exams</h4>
                <p>
                    After learning, practicing, and repeating the process, the
                    phone I was using broke, bringing my programming journey to
                    a halt.
                    <br />
                    I paused my learning to focus on my education. I graduated
                    from high school and got a job. With my earnings, I bought a
                    new phone, which I used to continue learning. Today, I build
                    websites at
                    <a href="https://treasureuzoma.netlify.app"
                        >https://treasureuzoma.netlify.app</a
                    >.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    I might not be the best person to tell you this, but if
                    you're still learning to code, don't give up.
                    <br />
                    Life will always present challenges, but never quit. Taking
                    breaks may be necessary too.
                </p>
                <p>Thank you for your time. Bye!</p>
